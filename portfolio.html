    <h4>What is a digital portfolio?</h4>
    <p>It isnâ€™t simply a statement towards employers. A good digital portfolio illustrates diverse skills and complex systems in a clean, plain view for teammates to quickly understand experiences, tools, and interests. <br><br>

        A current interest is having one or more successful open source projects under my belt, to have experience in collaborative coding. Secondly, I enjoy theoretical and performance assessments of my calculators in Rmd, to become a better analyst. Also, I have interests in citizen-science or science education projects including the PublicLab spectrophotometer and simple spectroscopy projects.</p>
